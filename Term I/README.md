# HOW TO RUN

Before running/compiling files directory needs to be set to `Term I`

### Task 1: Sorting Algorithms

To run Task 1, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 Assignment1/task1.py
```

This will run the sorting algorithms and generate the required results and plots.

### Task 2: C++ and Python Graph Analysis

1. **Compile and run the C++ program:**

   ```bash
   g++ Assignment1/task2.cpp -o Assignment1/task2

   ./Assignment1/task2
   ```

   This will generate the necessary output files for the next step.

2. **Run the Python graphing script:**
   ```bash
   python3 Assignment1/task2graph.py
   ```
   This will process the output and generate the required graphs.


### About `helpmodule`

The `helpmodule` directory inside `Assignment1` contains helper scripts used throughout the assignments:

- **arrays.py**: Pre-generated arrays of various sizes (small and large) for sorting and performance tests.
- **genArrays.py**: Functions and size lists to generate random arrays for experiments.
- **plot_csv.py**: Utilities to save results to CSV and plot performance graphs using matplotlib and pandas.

Each script will generate its respective results and outputs in the `Assignment1/results/` directory.

## Assignment 2

For each task in Assignment 2, simply run the corresponding Python script to generate the results.

- To run Task 1:
  ```bash
  python3 Assignment2/task1.py
  ```
- To run Task 2:
  ```bash
  python3 Assignment2/task2.py
  ```
- To run Task 3:
  ```bash
  python3 Assignment2/task3.py
  ```

Each script will generate its respective results and outputs in the `Assignment2/results/` directory.

Make sure you have all required Python packages installed (see `requirements.txt` in each assignment folder).
