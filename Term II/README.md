# HOW TO RUN

For each part of the assignments in Term II, use the provided `Makefile` to build and run the `task.cpp` file and generate results.

## General Instructions

Navigate to the relevant assignment part directory (e.g., `Assignment1/PartOne`, `Assignment1/PartTwo`, etc.) and run:

```bash
make

./task
```

This will use the Makefile to compile and execute the program, generating the required outputs and results in the corresponding `results/` directory.

---

Make sure you have any required dependencies installed (see `requirements.txt` if present in the assignment folder).
